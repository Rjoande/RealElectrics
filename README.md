# RealElectrics
Realistic Electrical Overhaul for KSP

**Real Electrics** is a fork and continuation of *Real Batteries* by Blackline, a mod that adds realistic behavior to electric charge storage in Kerbal Space Program.

Originally created around 2019, Real Batteries introduced a system where batteries store "StoredCharge" (SCe) internally, discharge at limited rates, and react to power demands more realistically.  
The project was left inactive for several years, but thanks to the MIT license, it can now be updated and expanded for modern KSP installs!

## Current Status
- Recompiled for **KSP 1.12.x** (latest stable version).
- Initial compatibility checks done with core electric mods (*Dynamic Battery Storage*, *SystemHeat*).
- Core mechanics are functional in sandbox testing.

## Roadmap
- **Integration:** Patch stock batteries and popular mod batteries to use Real Electrics logic (no need for special battery parts).
- **Upgrades:** Use B9PartSwitch and PartUpgrades to allow technology progression between chemistries (NiCd, NiMH, Li-Ion, etc.).
- **Temperature effects:** Improve thermal behavior and efficiency changes.
- **Compatibility:** Fully integrate with *Dynamic Battery Storage* and support *SystemHeat*.
- **UI improvements:** Show StoredCharge (SCe) clearly in the VAB and inflight menus.

## License
This project is licensed under the **MIT License**, following the original *Real Batteries* license.

Credit and thanks to **Blackline** for the original work!
